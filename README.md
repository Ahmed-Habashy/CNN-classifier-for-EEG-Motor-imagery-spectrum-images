# CNN-classifier-for-EEG-Motor-imagery-spectrum-images
The code requires the following libraries to be installed: Numpy, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Keras, Sklearn, Matplotlib, PIL. To run the code, specify the path to the input spectrum images folder in the "img_folder" variable. The code assumes the images are organized in sub-directories with the class label as the sub-directory name. The size of the input images is defined as IMG_HEIGHT = 32, IMG_WIDTH = 32. The code also sets the number of training epochs (n_epochs) to 300 and the batch size (n_batch) to 20. The code uses 10-fold cross-validation to train and evaluate the model, with the results stored in the "total_cnn_acc" list. The model will be saved in the current working directory as a .h5 file.
